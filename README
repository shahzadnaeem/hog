hog

Memory, CPU and CPU load hog utility.

I want to hog ...

A CPU - Effectively disabling one on a multi CPU machine
========================================================

./hog 0 <CPU>  -- <CPU> is the number of the CPU to TOTALLY hog

  And some memory while I'm at it
  ===============================

  ./hog <MEM> <CPU>  -- <MEM> is the number of megabytes to hog <CPU> as above

Memory and no CPU
=================

./hog <MEM> 0 0  -- <MEM> is the number of megabytes to hog

This is a tricky one, as hogging memory really requires some
CPU to hog effectively. Using <CPU> = 0 will result in the
time taken to hog the memory being quite long and may also
result in some memory being swapped out as a result

Memory and some CPU
===================

./hog <MEM> 0 <LOAD>  -- <MEM> as above and <LOAD> is the % load on the CPU
                         which in this case is 0 - use this for a single CPU
                         machine.

./hog <MEM> <CPU> <LOAD>  -- as above except choose <CPU> too

Just some CPU
=============

./hog 0 <CPU> <LOAD>  -- just set <MEM> to 0


Resonable Values
================

<MEM>	Up to the max allowed for your process and within sensible
	limits for the machine - asking for too much will lead to
	paging/swapping

<CPU>	Depends on number of CPUs on your machine

<LOAD>	Low values, less than 5%, are hard to achieve
